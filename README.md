# Model description
This is a Gaussian Naive Bayes model trained on a synthetic dataset, containining a large variety of transaction types representing normal activities as well as 
abnormal/fraudulent activities generated by J.P. Morgan AI Research. The model predicts whether a transaction is normal or fraudulent.

## Intended uses & limitations
For educational purposes

## Training Procedure
The data preprocessing steps applied include the following:
- Dropping high cardinality features. This includes Transaction ID, Sender ID, Sender Account, Beneficiary ID, Beneficiary Account, Sender Sector 
- Dropping no variance features. This includes Sender LOB
- Dropping Time and date feature since the model is not time-series based
- Transforming and Encoding categorical features namely: Sender Country, Beneficiary Country, Transaction Type, and the target variable, Label
- Applying feature scaling on all features
- Splitting the dataset into training/test set using 85/15 split ratio
- Handling imbalanced dataset using imblearn framework and applying RandomUnderSampler method to eliminate noise which led to a 2.5% improvement in accuracy
